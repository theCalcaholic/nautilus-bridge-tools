# Nautilus Bridge Tools

A handy collection of scripts for Nautilus' file context menu.

## Installation

The easiest way is by using git:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/nautilus/scripts
cd ~/.local/share/nautilus/scripts
git clone git@github.com:theCalcaholic/nautilus-bridge-tools.git bridge-tools
```

You should find the scripts under Scripts -> bridge-tools if you right-click a file in Nautilus.
